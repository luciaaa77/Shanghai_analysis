## Data and codes
This repository contains the majority of the analytical process in the thesis. 
The data used for analysis in each stage is contained in the folder for each stage specifically; since the CRIC database that I employed is a private database,

made those figures on my own. These parts are in the Stage II- QGIS folder and contain the distribution maps and the GWR coefficient maps,
